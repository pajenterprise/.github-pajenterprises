Issues created here will be addressed or pointed to their original (private) issues boards. This gives you, the customer, the ability to have a central location to go to file feature requests and issues where we can provide updates. Some of our original issues boards do need to remain private for various reasons, including not giving away some of the awesome things we are working on before they are ready!
